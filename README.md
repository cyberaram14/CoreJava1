##CoreJava1 Stuff
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository will store code I type as I learn from the book "CORE JAVA Volume 1 - Fundamentals (11th E.)"
Book website: https://horstmann.com/corejava/index.html

"workspace" folders store code I type code to mess around and test code. Simlar to a sketchbook artists use to test out their ideas and "mess around"
"formal" folders store code I formally type (small projects, or big, etc.) - basically anything that wouldn't fit into "workspace" folder
